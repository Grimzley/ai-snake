# Reinforcement Learning Agent

Recreated the Snake game using the Pygame library\
Developed a Deep Q-Learning agent to play Snake autonomously\
Implemented a neural network with Pytorch\
Tuned hyperparameters and included reward shaping to accelerate training\
Saves the model for watching and further training

###### Usage

Playing:
Move the Snake using the arrow keys

Training & Watching:
1) Enter checkpoint file to load model (leave blank to train new model)
2) Enter state vector size

###### Wishlist
